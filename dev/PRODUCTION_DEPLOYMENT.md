const supabaseKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
const DEV_TABLE_NAME = 'daily_david_entries_dev';

// WITH THIS (PROD CONFIG):
const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_URL';
const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
const TABLE_NAME = 'daily_david_entries';
```

### 3.3 Update All Table References
Find and replace all instances of:
- `DEV_TABLE_NAME` → `TABLE_NAME`
- `daily_david_entries_dev` → `daily_david_entries`
